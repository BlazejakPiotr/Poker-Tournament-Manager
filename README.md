# POKER TOURNAMENT MANAGER

https://pt-manager.vercel.app/

`Introduction`
PTM is a free web app to manage home-made poker tournaments made by Strive School student as a capstone project.

`An idea`
Idea to create this application came about 5 years ago but I didn't know how to program. At this time web apps like this wasn't available and there was no point of buying proffesional program like The Tournament Director just for kitchen table tournaments created for few people.

`MVP`
In the very first version of this app user should be able to:
-create one tournament
-set players and manage their state (buy-in,re-buy,add-on,bust out)
-set levels automaticly and manually
-set tables and assign players to them
-calculate monetary obligations for each player and prize pool
-start/pause/stop/fastforward/backward timer

`Extra features`
For the future I'm also planning extra features for this app like:
-back-end
-user registration
-club creator
-create multiple tournaments (or maybe even league)
-tournaments history
-save template of tournament or players, rounds
-chat

`Tools`
Toolset currently used in application
-Bootstrap
-React
-Redux

this document will scale as an app grows...
